# Solidity Savings Account

A simple savings account smart contract. Features:

1. The contract is assigned a target date
2. Anyone can fund the contract
3. The owner can withdraw funds at anytime if the eth price has increased and there'd be a net profit. If this isn't the case, the owner must wait until the target date to withdraw funds.
